"""Single-agent vacuous-pass / no-output guard (task #2371).

The existing vacuous-pass guard in :mod:`equipa.hooks.vacuous_pass` only runs
on the Dev+Test loop's ``dev_test:fail`` / ``attempt:after`` events. When the
CLI is invoked as ``equipa --task X --role Y`` (single-agent mode, no
``--dev-test``), the loop is skipped entirely and so is the guard. As a
result a no-output planner / code-reviewer run was happily marked SUCCESS
and the task row set to DONE — exactly the failure that bit task #2361 on
2026-05-14, when a planner wrote zero files but the orchestrator recorded
``tests_passed`` and even trusted a hallucinated
``TASKS_CREATED: 78,79,80,81,82`` line that referenced unrelated
pre-existing ForgeBridge tickets from January.

This module provides the role-aware "did the agent actually produce
output?" checks that must run on EVERY single-agent role completion:

* :func:`evaluate_single_agent_outcome` — given a role, a task id, the
  agent's run-result dict, and the repo path, returns a
  :class:`SingleAgentOutcome` whose ``is_blocked`` flag is True when the
  run produced no on-disk evidence. The exact "no output" definition is
  role-dependent (see ``_FILE_PRODUCING_ROLES`` and ``_REVIEW_ROLES``).
* :func:`validate_tasks_created_claim` — rejects agent stdout containing a
  ``TASKS_CREATED:`` line whose IDs (a) do not exist, (b) were created
  before the run started, or (c) belong to a different project than the
  one the agent was dispatched against.

The orchestrator's CLI single-agent branch (see ``equipa/cli.py`` around
the ``# Single-agent mode (Phase 1 — with model tiering)`` block) consults
these helpers and downgrades the recorded outcome to ``"no_output"``
(treated as failure by ``_post_task_telemetry``) when the guard trips.
