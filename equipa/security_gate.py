"""Security-gate helpers — task #2360 + task #2451.

This module owns the small, pure decisions the parallel and single-task
dispatch paths need to make about the security-review gate:

  * ``is_doc_only_diff(changed_files)`` — True when every changed file is
    a documentation file (.md/.txt/.rst/...). Such diffs cannot introduce
    code-level vulnerabilities, so the security gate must not block them
    on prose-matching false positives. Concrete trigger: task #2358, a
    pure CRYPTOTRADER-V3-ARCHITECTURE.md spec, was blocked because the
    document used the word "HIGH" and discussed API-key auth.

  * ``SecurityGateBypassError`` — the defensive invariant raised by
    ``dispatch._merge_task_branch`` when its artifact re-check trips.

  * ``format_counts`` / ``_gate_audit_log`` — shared helpers for the
    [GATE-AUDIT] telemetry line both dispatch paths emit.

Task #2451 Phase J (F-03 fix): an earlier draft also exposed
``evaluate_gate`` + ``GateVerdict`` — a second open-coded gate policy
that lived in parallel with the one in ``dispatch._gated_merge_task``.
That duplication was the same architectural shape as the original
parent bug (decoupled single-task and parallel gates that drifted out
of sync), so it has been deleted. The gate policy now lives in EXACTLY
one place: ``dispatch._gated_merge_task`` + the defensive invariant in
``dispatch._merge_task_branch``. Future callers needing the gate decision
must go through that one path.

class GateDecision:
    """The single, ground-truth merge-gate decision (task #2706).

    Prior to task #2706 the gated merge relied on three interacting
    *caller-supplied* signals — a tri-state ``review_blocks_merge``, an
    ``expect_artifact`` doc-only hint, and the ``outcome`` — whose correct
    combination lived only in prose comments across ``dispatch``/``cli``.
    The ``expect_artifact=False`` doc-only short-circuit skipped the
    fail-closed invariant *entirely*, so a future caller passing it wrongly
    would silently disable the last line of defence — exactly the
    caller-trust hole the invariant was built to close.

    A ``GateDecision`` is now computed by :func:`decide_merge_gate` from
    GROUND TRUTH INSIDE ``dispatch._gated_merge_task``:

      * ``changed_files`` — the ACTUAL branch diff (``git diff base...branch``),
        never a caller flag.
      * ``doc_only`` — re-derived by calling :func:`is_doc_only_diff` on that
        real file list (which fails closed on an empty list).
      * ``counts`` / ``blocks_merge`` — read from the on-disk
        ``SECURITY-REVIEW-<task>.md`` artifact, fail-closed on missing.

    The dataclass is frozen so a decision cannot be mutated after it is
    computed. ``expect_artifact`` is an explicit field the gate DERIVES (it
    is False for a provably doc-only diff and when the operator has disabled
    security review outright, True otherwise) so the defensive invariant in
    ``_merge_task_branch`` receives an internally computed value, never a
    caller assertion.

    This is the ONE place the gate policy is decided. It takes the real
    branch diff (``changed_files``, produced by
    :func:`get_changed_files_for_branch`) plus a callable that reads the
    on-disk security-review artifact, and returns an immutable decision.

    NO per-task caller-supplied security-state booleans participate — those
    (the old tri-state ``review_blocks_merge`` / ``expect_artifact`` /
    ``doc_only`` signals) were the caller-trust hole task #2706 closes:

      * doc-only-ness is re-derived here via :func:`is_doc_only_diff` on the
        real file list — a caller can no longer assert ``doc_only`` to
        disable the gate.
      * when the diff is NOT doc-only, the artifact is (re-)read through the
        injected ``security_review_blocks_merge`` callable, which fails
        closed on a missing/unparseable artifact when ``block_on_missing``.

    The two GLOBAL operator-policy flags below are NOT per-task trust signals
    (they are the operator's feature-flag configuration, the same trust
    boundary as today) and are threaded through so unification does not
    silently change behaviour:

      * ``security_review_enabled`` — when the operator has disabled security
        review entirely, no artifact is ever produced, so none is expected
        (``expect_artifact=False``) and the gate does not block. This is the
        operator's explicit opt-out, not a gate weakness.
      * ``block_on_missing`` — the ``security_review_block_on_missing_
        artifact`` fail-open escape hatch (defaults fail-closed).

    LAYERING NOTE (task #2706, resolves the cycle-1 tester's open question):
    ``block_on_missing=False`` relaxes ONLY this policy layer — for a code diff
    with a missing artifact it makes this function return
    ``blocks_merge=False``. It does NOT relax the independent defensive
    invariant in ``dispatch._merge_task_branch``: because a code diff yields
    ``expect_artifact=True``, that invariant re-reads the artifact, finds it
    missing, and raises ``SecurityGateBypassError`` regardless of the flag. So
    for a code diff the fail-open flag is effectively INERT (the unified gate
    stays strictly fail-closed on a missing artifact, satisfying the #2706
    "never looser than today" constraint); the flag is only observable on the
    ``expect_artifact=False`` paths (doc-only / review-disabled), where no
    artifact is expected in the first place. This is intentional — documented,
    not a code change — so an operator never mistakes it for a way to merge an
    unreviewed code diff. See
    ``test_block_on_missing_false_is_still_caught_by_defensive_invariant``.

    ``security_review_blocks_merge`` is injected (rather than imported) so
    this leaf module stays free of a circular import on ``dispatch`` while
    the decision logic remains unit-testable in isolation. It must have the
    signature ``(project_dir, task_id, *, block_on_missing) ->
    tuple[bool, dict | None]`` — i.e. ``dispatch._security_review_blocks_merge``.

    ROLE OVERLAYS (SR-2994 S1): a diff that touches a project role overlay
    (``.equipa/roles/``) ALWAYS blocks, checked before every other rule —
    ``.md`` overlays would otherwise pass as doc-only, and an overlay is an
    agent instruction set that only the operator may approve.

        ``cli`` can import it without a circular dependency (GATE-07).
      * Writes ONLY to ``sys.stderr`` — the prior implementation also called

      * The ``EQUIPA_GATE_AUDIT_LOG`` env gate silences the stderr line
        (default ``"1"`` = emit) so CI capture does not double-emit.

    Task #2702 — durable persistence (NEW, additive):
      * In addition to the stderr line, each gate event is persisted to the
        ``agent_actions`` table so a post-hoc audit of "why did this branch
        merge or block" survives a lost nohup log.
      * Callers SUPPLY the structured ``task_id`` (and optional ``event`` /
        ``counts``) rather than this function parsing its own message string.
        As a compatibility net for callers that pre-date the kwargs, a narrow
        ``task=<n>`` fallback is parsed from ``message`` — the structured
        param always takes precedence.
      * Persistence is INDEPENDENT of ``EQUIPA_GATE_AUDIT_LOG``: that env gate
        only silences the stderr line (a CI double-emit concern); the audit
        trail must remain durable even when stderr is muted.
      * The DB write is best-effort FAIL-OPEN — any error is swallowed inside

        decision or raise into the merge path. ``equipa.db`` is imported
