"""EQUIPA initiative orchestration runner (Phase 2).

Phase 1 built the *spine*: the ``initiatives`` table, per-initiative plan
files, prompt injection at dispatch, and ``ORCHESTRATOR_OUTPUT`` parsing.
Phase 2 makes the orchestrator actually *orchestrate*: given an initiative
id it walks the sub-task dependency DAG, dispatches the tasks in waves,
halts on the first failure or operator pause marker, tracks accumulated
cost, and supports idempotent resume after a halt.

Design (operator-locked 2026-05-28):

* **Failure handling** — HALT + pause on any sub-task failure or
  gate-block. The initiative is marked ``paused``, an open_question is
  filed, and the operator resumes by re-running ``--initiative <id>``.
* **Pause markers** — operator-only, hand-edited into the human-editable
  section of the plan file (above ``BEGIN ORCHESTRATOR-MANAGED``). A
  newly-seen ``<!-- pause-for-review reason="..." -->`` marker halts the
  run before the next wave.
* **Cost** — accumulated into ``initiatives.total_cost``; no enforced cap.
* **A paused initiative is the EXPECTED outcome of any failure**, not an
  error. The runner returns a structured result and the CLI exits 0 on a
  pause; only unexpected exceptions propagate non-zero.

Testability: the wave loop calls an injectable ``dispatch_fn`` seam, so
the DAG / wave / pause / cost / status-transition logic can be unit
tested without spawning real agents. The default seam dispatches via the
existing parallel-tasks machinery and reads each task's terminal status
and cost back from TheForge.

    The wave dispatcher trusts ``run_parallel_tasks`` to isolate each task on
    its own ``forge-task-<id>`` branch. That isolation has regressed before
    (open_question 2026-05-18: local-branch contamination under concurrent
    same-repo dispatch). Rather than trust it blindly, after each wave we
    assert the invariant the #2488/#2490 worktree fix establishes: every
    dispatched task has its own ``forge-task-<id>`` branch, and no two tasks'
    branches resolve to the IDENTICAL commit (a tell-tale of leaked shared
    working-tree state where one task's commit landed on another's branch).

    ``wave_base`` is the recorded pre-wave HEAD (the commit every task branch
    was forked from). A task that legitimately makes NO commits (doc-only or
    no-op tasks, dispatched regularly by this project) leaves its branch tip
    pointing AT the base. Two such zero-commit tasks in the same wave would
    otherwise collide on an identical HEAD and be spuriously flagged as
    contamination — a false halt of a healthy wave (N1). So a shared HEAD that
    equals ``wave_base`` is NOT contamination: those branches simply committed
    nothing. Only a shared HEAD that has ADVANCED PAST the base (i.e. a real
    commit landed on more than one branch) is a true isolation violation. When
    ``wave_base`` is ``None`` the check falls back to the conservative
    "any shared HEAD is a violation" behaviour.

    Returns ``{task_id: violation_message}`` for each task that fails the
    invariant (empty dict = clean). Best-effort: if the repo path is missing
    or git is unavailable, returns ``{}`` (cannot prove a violation, so do
    not manufacture a halt). The caller downgrades violating tasks so the
    initiative halts instead of advancing on contaminated work.
