"""Auto-clone ForgeScaffold for new scaffold-based projects.

When a task targets a project that is built on ForgeScaffold but whose local
directory does not yet contain any code (empty, missing, or only carries a
placeholder ``CLAUDE.md``), the orchestrator copies the scaffold tree into
the project directory and rewrites ``CLAUDE.md`` to reflect the actual
project — not ForgeScaffold itself.

Public entry point: :func:`ensure_scaffold`. Both ``equipa.cli`` and
``equipa.dispatch`` call it just before they would otherwise abort with
"project directory does not exist" / "directory has no code".

Design notes
------------
* Detection is conservative: a directory is considered "uninitialized" only
  when it does not exist, is empty, or contains exclusively a single
  ``CLAUDE.md`` (the placeholder pattern the orchestrator drops in when it
  registers a new project). Any other content means the project has been
  seeded by hand and we must NOT touch it.
* The scaffold source is resolved from (in order): an explicit
  ``EQUIPA_FORGESCAFFOLD_DIR`` environment variable, the
  ``forgescaffold_dir`` key in ``forge_config.json``/``dispatch_config.json``.
  There is no built-in fallback: with neither set, auto-clone is refused.
* Copy excludes ``node_modules``, ``.next``, build/dist artefacts, and any
  ``.git`` directory — the destination is meant to be a fresh repository
  rooted at the project directory.
* ``CLAUDE.md`` is always regenerated from project metadata (DB row,
  open-questions, recent decisions). The Agent Quick Start section is
  injected at the top so the first agent to touch the new project does not
  have to hunt for the "where do I put code" answer.
