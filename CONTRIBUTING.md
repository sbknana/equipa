# Contributing to EQUIPA

EQUIPA is a multi-agent orchestrator for software-engineering tasks. This guide
gets you from a fresh clone to a green PR. It is meant to be scannable — skim
the headings, run the commands.

## 1. Local setup

Clone the repo, then wire up the repo-tracked git hooks so the pre-commit
checks run on your machine:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> equipa && cd equipa
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

That is the whole install. EQUIPA is **pure Python standard library** — there
is nothing to `pip install` and no virtualenv to create (see
[§3, Zero dependencies](#3-zero-dependencies)). You need **Python 3.10+**.

The `core.hooksPath` setting is local to your clone and only needs to be
applied once. It enables the [artifact-hygiene](#4-artifact-hygiene)
pre-commit hook in `.githooks/pre-commit`.

## 2. Running the test suite

The suite is `pytest`-based. It never touches a real TheForge database: point
`THEFORGE_DB` at a throwaway path and every test (and `tests/conftest.py`'s
schema-apply) uses it instead.

```bash
# From the repo root:
THEFORGE_DB="$(mktemp -d)/theforge-test.db" pytest -q
```

For a run that mirrors CI exactly (with the slowest 15 tests reported):

```bash
THEFORGE_DB="$(mktemp -d)/theforge-test.db" pytest -q --durations=15
```

- `pytest` is the **only** test-time dependency. Install it with
  `pip install pytest` (it is not needed to run EQUIPA itself, only to test it).
- Run a single file or test with the usual pytest selectors, e.g.
  `pytest -q tests/test_gen_module_report.py::test_generation_is_deterministic`.

## 3. Zero dependencies

EQUIPA depends only on the Python standard library. This is a hard constraint,
not a preference:

- **No third-party runtime imports.** No `requests`, no `pydantic`, no ORM.
  Use `urllib`, `sqlite3`, `json`, `ast`, `argparse`, `subprocess`, etc.
- **No `pip install` to run.** Copy the `equipa/` folder onto any machine with
  Python 3.10+ and it works. Zero supply-chain surface.
- `pytest` is the single exception, and only for the test suite — never import
  it from `equipa/` or `scripts/` production code.

If a change would introduce a runtime dependency, it will be rejected. Solve
the problem with the stdlib or reconsider the design.

## 4. Artifact hygiene

EQUIPA agents emit transient review/plan files. These must **never** be
committed at the repository root — they make the public repo noisy and can leak
project-internal context. They belong in `.equipa-artifacts/` (gitignored).

The pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, enabled in [§1](#1-local-setup))
rejects a commit that stages any of these at the repo root:

```
SECURITY-REVIEW-*.md   CODE-REVIEW-*.md   PLAN-*.md
RETRY-IMPLEMENTATION-*.md   RETRY-VERIFICATION.md
GEPA-EPISODE-CHECK-*.md   LEAN-CTX-PORT.md
```

The same names inside a subdirectory (e.g. `docs/PLAN-architecture.md`) are
fine — only repo-root droppings are blocked. If the hook fires:

```bash
mkdir -p .equipa-artifacts
mv <file> .equipa-artifacts/
git reset HEAD <file>
```

## 5. Branch & PR conventions

- **Branch** off the default branch (`main`); never commit directly to it.
  Task-driven work uses `forge-task-<id>` branches.
- **Commits** follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`,
  `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`. Keep one logical change per commit.
- **Open a PR** against `main`. All CI checks (below) must be green before
  merge. Rebase or update the branch if `main` has moved.

## 6. Continuous integration

Three GitHub Actions workflows gate every push and pull request. Reproduce each
locally before pushing.

| Workflow | File | What it enforces |
|---|---|---|
| Tests | `.github/workflows/tests.yml` | Runs `pytest -q --durations=15` under Python 3.12 with a hermetic `THEFORGE_DB`. The full suite must pass. |
| Docs Drift Check | `.github/workflows/docs-drift-check.yml` | Runs `scripts/check_docs_drift.py`: doc/README path references resolve, the README module & test-badge counts are within tolerance, and the committed module report is not stale (see [§7](#7-generated-docs--drift)). |
| Plugin Boundary Check | `.github/workflows/plugin-boundary-check.yml` | Core `equipa/` must never directly import a plugin package — plugins integrate only through `equipa.plugins` entry points. |

Run the doc-drift check locally with:

```bash
python scripts/check_docs_drift.py --repo-root "$PWD"
```

## 7. Generated docs & drift

Some committed docs are **generated**, not hand-written. Editing them by hand
will fail CI. Regenerate them instead.

### Module dependency report

`equipa/MODULE_DEPENDENCY_REPORT.md` is produced by an AST import-walk of the
`equipa/` package. The generator is **deterministic** (no timestamps, fully
sorted), so re-runs are byte-identical and drift is detectable. After any change
to the package's modules or imports, regenerate it:

```bash
python scripts/gen_module_report.py            # rewrite the report
python scripts/gen_module_report.py --check     # exit 1 if it is stale
```

The Docs Drift Check CI job runs the generator into a buffer and fails if the
committed report differs by a single byte. Do not edit the file by hand.

### Generated files in the gated merge

Every task branch regenerates the report, so in a parallel `--tasks` batch the
second and later branches always conflict in it. Generated files are therefore
declared, with their generator, in one place:
`equipa.generated_files.GENERATED_FILES`. When the orchestrator's gated merge
conflicts **only** in declared files, it regenerates them from the merged tree,
stages them, completes the merge commit and logs
`GATE-AUDIT ... event=generated-files-regenerated files=<paths>`. Any other
conflicting path keeps the ordinary behaviour (abort, `merge_failed`, branch
preserved), and a project without the declared file or generator is unaffected.

The generator is code from the merged tree, which agents can write, so:

- it runs only if its blob is identical on the pinned default branch, on the
  task branch and in the merged tree. A branch that changed the generator ends
  `merge_failed` with "the task branch changed the generator"; it is never run;
- it runs as `python -I` in a private `git archive` export of the merged tree
  (never in the main checkout or the orchestrator's process), with the scrubbed
  agent environment minus the Claude CLI credential, and a timeout that kills
  its whole process group. It must print the file's new content to stdout; a
  failure, empty output or timeout ends `merge_failed` with a clean checkout;
- the recorded `merged_sha` is the resolution commit. The merge-integrity
  check (task #3116) accepts it only when its tree equals
  `git merge-tree --write-tree <default> <approved>` everywhere except the
  regenerated paths, which must be exactly that merge's conflicted paths and
  regular files. A resolution touching any other path trips the guard.

To declare another generated file, add a `GeneratedFile(path, generator, args)`
entry; the generator must accept a repository root and print to stdout.

## 8. Skill manifest integrity

Role prompts and skill files are integrity-protected. `skill_manifest.json`
stores a SHA-256 hash of each prompt/skill file; at runtime
`verify_skill_integrity` compares the files against those hashes and refuses to
run if they were tampered with.

When you **intentionally** change a role prompt or skill file, regenerate the
manifest so its hashes match — otherwise every dispatch will fail integrity
verification:

```bash
python -m equipa --regenerate-manifest
```

Commit the updated `skill_manifest.json` alongside your prompt/skill change. If
you see a runtime warning to *"Run --regenerate-manifest if changes are
intentional,"* this is the command it means.
