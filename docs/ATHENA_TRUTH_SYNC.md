# Athena Weekly Truth-Sync

<!-- drift-ignore -->
<!--
  All paths in this document are written relative to the repo root (e.g.
  `scripts/athena_truth_sync.sh`), not relative to docs/.  The drift
  checker resolves backtick paths against the containing doc's directory,
  which would falsely flag every path on this page.  The drift-ignore
  marker above tells check_docs_drift.py to skip path validation for the
  remainder of this file.

EQUIPA's repo-consistency workflow has four layers; this document covers
Layer 2.

| Layer | What                              | Where it lives                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0     | Hygiene (agent artifacts off root) | `.equipa-artifacts/`, gitignore      |
| 1     | Drift fence (CI)                   | `scripts/check_docs_drift.py` + GH Action |
| **2** | **Weekly Athena truth-sync (cron)** | **`scripts/athena_truth_sync.sh`**   |
| 3     | Manual `/repo-audit` skill         | `skills/repo-audit/`                 |

Layer 1 detects drift; Layer 2 fixes it.

## What the cron does

Every Sunday at 05:00 UTC, the cron runs `scripts/athena_truth_sync.sh`,
which:

1. Acquires an exclusive `flock` on `/tmp/athena-truth-sync.lock`. If
   another run already holds the lock, the script logs and quietly
   exits 0 (no concurrent runs).
2. Verifies the default branch is `master` or `main`. Any other branch
   aborts the run loudly.
3. Refuses to start when the local checkout has uncommitted changes.
4. Fast-forwards the local checkout to `origin/<default-branch>`.
5. Calls Athena (`generate-docs --scan --model quality`) to regenerate
   `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, etc. from current code. A
   non-zero Athena exit is **fatal** -- the working tree is reset and
   the run aborts.
6. Asserts `git status --porcelain` mentions only `README.md` and
   `docs/`. Anything else is reverted with `git checkout --` and the
   run aborts (Athena's output domain is documentation only).
7. Runs `scripts/athena_sync_readme.py` to reconcile the root
   `README.md` against the Athena output and live counts. The helper
   applies a **markdown-only content allowlist** to the Athena-supplied
   Architecture block (see [Content allowlist](#content-allowlist)
   below). A poisoned Athena output causes a fail-closed abort before
   the splice writes to `README.md`.
8. Re-runs `scripts/check_docs_drift.py` to verify the fence is clean.
   If drift remains, the cron files a TheForge `open_question` (via a
   parameterized Python helper) and skips the push.
9. Creates a **GPG-signed** commit
   `[athena-audit] weekly README truth-sync (<DATE>)` using a dedicated
   bot identity (`EQUIPA truth-sync bot <athena-bot@forgeborn.dev>`)
   and pushes directly to the default branch. No PR. If signing fails
   for any reason (missing key, expired key, gpg unavailable) the run
   aborts -- there is no unsigned fallback.
10. If the diff is non-trivial (>50 line README delta), files an
    `open_question` summarizing what changed for human review.

## Content allowlist

Athena's output domain is **markdown documentation only**. Athena must
never emit code files, raw HTML (other than `<!-- comments -->`),
JavaScript, executable URIs, event handlers, or non-printable bytes.

`scripts/athena_sync_readme.py:validate_athena_content()` is the
fail-closed gate. It is a pure function `(content: str) -> (ok, reason)`
so each attack vector is unit-tested in isolation (see
`tests/test_athena_truth_sync.py`).

Rejected patterns:

* HTML tags matching `<\s*(script|iframe|object|embed|svg|style|link|
  meta|frame|frameset|applet|form|input|button|on[a-z]+)\b`.
* Any other inline HTML tag (e.g. `<a>`, `<div>`) outside of fenced
  code blocks. Markdown comments `<!-- ... -->` are permitted.
* `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:text/html`, `file://` URIs inside
  markdown link/image targets.
* Event-handler attributes (`onclick=`, `onload=`, ...).
* Non-printable control characters other than `\n` and `\t`.
* Architecture blocks larger than 50KB (`MAX_ATHENA_BLOCK_BYTES`).

A rejected Athena block exits the sync script with rc=3, which the
bash runner translates into a fatal abort.

## Commit signing

The truth-sync cron commits with `git commit -S` against a dedicated
GPG key. The key is **never shared** with developer commits.

* Identity: `EQUIPA truth-sync bot <athena-bot@forgeborn.dev>`
* **Pinned by long-format fingerprint, NOT by email** (task #2485 S3).
  Email-based key selection is trivially spoofable: any imported key
  whose UID lists the same email could be picked by gpg. The cron's
  preflight rejects `ATHENA_SIGNING_KEY` unless it is a 40-hex
  fingerprint, refuses to start if that fingerprint is not present in
  the secret keyring, and refuses to start if it resolves to more than
  one distinct primary key (defence against UID-collision swap).
* **Current bot key fingerprint:**
  `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
  *(placeholder -- the real fingerprint must be set by the operator via
  the `ATHENA_SIGNING_KEY` env var on the cron host; the default is a
  fail-closed sentinel that is guaranteed not to resolve to any key).*
* Imported under user `user`'s GPG keyring (`gpg --list-secret-keys
  <fingerprint>` must list it; the cron inherits `user`'s environment).

The script does **not** generate the key. Generation/installation is
operator-driven:

```bash
# One-time, on Claudinator, as `user`:
gpg --quick-gen-key 'EQUIPA truth-sync bot <athena-bot@forgeborn.dev>' \
    ed25519 sign 2y

# Capture the long-format fingerprint (40 hex chars, no spaces):
FPR="$(gpg --list-secret-keys --with-colons athena-bot@forgeborn.dev \
       | awk -F: '/^fpr:/ {print $10; exit}')"
echo "$FPR" | tee /srv/share/Athena/keys/athena-bot.fingerprint

# Verify git can sign:
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign -u "$FPR" >/dev/null

# Install the fingerprint into the cron environment (crontab or env file):
#   export ATHENA_SIGNING_KEY=<fingerprint>

# Upload the public key to GitHub under the bot account.
gpg --armor --export "$FPR" | xclip -selection clipboard
```

If `gpg` is unavailable, the key is expired, the keyring is
inaccessible, or the fingerprint is missing/ambiguous, the cron aborts
with a clear log line -- it never falls back to an unsigned commit.

### Key rotation

When the bot key reaches expiry or is suspected of compromise:

1. **Generate a replacement key** on Claudinator as `user`:
   ```bash
   gpg --quick-gen-key 'EQUIPA truth-sync bot <athena-bot@forgeborn.dev>' \
       ed25519 sign 2y
   NEW_FPR="$(gpg --list-secret-keys --with-colons athena-bot@forgeborn.dev \
              | awk -F: '/^fpr:/ {print $10}' | tail -n1)"
   ```
2. **Confirm the new fingerprint is unique** in the keyring -- if the
   old key has not yet been deleted, the preflight will reject the
   ambiguous lookup. Either delete the old secret key first, or pass
   the NEW fingerprint explicitly (which is what the preflight does).
3. **Update the cron env**: edit the crontab line (or the env file the
   cron sources) to set `ATHENA_SIGNING_KEY=$NEW_FPR`. The placeholder
   default in the script intentionally fails closed, so a missing env
   override is loud rather than silent.
4. **Update this document**: replace the "Current bot key fingerprint"
   value above with `$NEW_FPR`. Reviewers should grep
   `ATHENA_SIGNING_KEY` in this file when auditing rotations.
5. **Update GitHub** to trust the new public key under the bot account
   (`gpg --armor --export $NEW_FPR | gh ssh-key add` or via the UI).
6. **Revoke and delete the old secret** once the new key is verified
   working end-to-end:
   ```bash
   gpg --gen-revoke <old-fpr>      # produce + publish revocation cert
   gpg --delete-secret-keys <old-fpr>
   ```
7. **Run the cron manually once** to confirm the new key signs and
   pushes cleanly (see "Manual force-run" below).

## When it runs

```cron
0 5 * * 0 /srv/share/Equipa-repo/scripts/athena_truth_sync.sh \
    >> /var/log/athena-truth-sync.log 2>&1
```

Installed on Claudinator as user `user`. The schedule is weekly (not
daily) because drift accumulates slowly and noisy cron commits add no
value.

## Manual force-run

```bash
/srv/share/Equipa-repo/scripts/athena_truth_sync.sh
```

The script reads its configuration from environment variables, so a
dry-run against a scratch checkout looks like:

```bash
EQUIPA_REPO=/tmp/equipa-test \
ATHENA_DIR=/srv/share/Athena \
THEFORGE_DB=/tmp/forge.db \
ATHENA_LOCKFILE=/tmp/athena-test.lock \
/srv/share/Equipa-repo/scripts/athena_truth_sync.sh
```

Override env vars:

| Variable                 | Default                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `EQUIPA_REPO`            | `/srv/share/Equipa-repo`                   |
| `ATHENA_DIR`             | `/srv/share/Athena`                        |
| `ATHENA_CLI`             | `${ATHENA_DIR}/dist/cli.js`                               |
| `ATHENA_MODEL`           | `quality`                                                 |
| `PYTHON_BIN`             | `python3`                                                 |
| `ATHENA_SIGNING_KEY`     | `0000...0` (40-hex fail-closed sentinel; operator MUST override with the bot key fingerprint) |
| `ATHENA_BOT_NAME`        | `EQUIPA truth-sync bot`                                   |
| `ATHENA_BOT_EMAIL`       | `athena-bot@forgeborn.dev`                                |
| `ATHENA_LOCKFILE`        | `/tmp/athena-truth-sync.lock`                             |
| `THEFORGE_DB`            | `/srv/share/TheForge/theforge.db`          |
| `EQUIPA_PROJECT_ID`      | `23`                                                      |
| `BADGE_DELTA_THRESHOLD`  | `50` (lines changed in README to count as "non-trivial")  |

## Disabling temporarily

Comment out the crontab line on Claudinator:

```bash
crontab -e
# Prefix the line with `#`:
# 0 5 * * 0 /srv/share/Equipa-repo/scripts/athena_truth_sync.sh ...
```

To remove it entirely:

```bash
crontab -l | grep -v athena_truth_sync | crontab -
crontab -l | grep athena_truth_sync   # should print nothing
```

## Installation (one-time)

```bash
# 1. Ensure the logfile is writable by `user` and has restrictive mode.
#    0640 keeps the log readable by user+group but not world (Athena
#    drift output can contain repo file paths and reviewer summaries).
sudo install -m 0640 -o user -g user /dev/null /var/log/athena-truth-sync.log

# 2. Install logrotate so the log does not grow unbounded.
sudo tee /etc/logrotate.d/athena-truth-sync <<'EOF'
/var/log/athena-truth-sync.log {
    weekly
    rotate 8
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0640 user user
}
EOF

# 3. Verify the GPG bot key is installed (see "Commit signing" above).
#    Use the long-format fingerprint; the cron's preflight rejects
#    email-based lookups.
gpg --list-secret-keys "$ATHENA_SIGNING_KEY" || exit 1

# 4. Add the cron entry.
crontab -l > /tmp/cron.bak
( crontab -l; \
  echo '0 5 * * 0 /srv/share/Equipa-repo/scripts/athena_truth_sync.sh >> /var/log/athena-truth-sync.log 2>&1' \
) | crontab -

# 5. Verify.
crontab -l | grep athena_truth_sync
```

If `sudo` is unavailable on the cron host, redirect the log into `/tmp`
with restrictive umask (`umask 027 && touch /tmp/athena-truth-sync.log`)
instead.

## Safety guards

* **Single-instance flock** -- `/tmp/athena-truth-sync.lock` prevents
  overlapping runs. The script re-execs itself under `flock -n` and
  exits 0 quietly if the lock is already held.
* **Default-branch allowlist** -- only `master` and `main` are accepted;
  any other value aborts the run.
* **Clean-checkout guard** -- the run aborts if `git diff --quiet HEAD`
  reports uncommitted changes.
* **Drift-checker preflight** -- `check_docs_drift.py --self-test`
  must succeed before the run continues.
* **Markdown-only content allowlist** -- `validate_athena_content()`
  rejects any HTML/JS injection vector before the README splice.
* **Preserve-boundary check** -- the sync helper refuses to operate on
  a README that has lost its `## What It Actually Does` heading.
* **Athena exit is fatal** -- a non-zero Athena exit resets the working
  tree and aborts; no partial commits.
* **Scope guard** -- `git status --porcelain` is asserted to mention
  only `README.md` and `docs/`. Anything else is reverted and the
  run aborts.
* **Post-sync drift verification** -- if drift remains after the sync
  the cron files an `open_question` and skips the push.
* **GPG-signed commits** -- mandatory; no unsigned fallback.
* **Parameterized SQL** -- `open_questions` inserts go through
  `scripts/athena_open_question.py` (sqlite3 placeholders), never
  through shell-quoted strings.
* **No PR review** -- the workflow is "Athena is authoritative for the
  machine-verifiable sections." Human review happens via the
  `open_question` filed on non-trivial repairs.

## How to debug a failed run

The cron tees stdout/stderr to `/var/log/athena-truth-sync.log` (or
`/tmp/athena-truth-sync.log` when no sudo). Each line is prefixed with
`[athena-truth-sync <UTC timestamp>]`. The most common failure modes:

* `another truth-sync run holds /tmp/athena-truth-sync.lock` -- a
  prior run is still in flight. Investigate before forcing a manual run.
* `uncommitted changes detected` -- the local checkout has dirty
  files. Stash or revert before re-running.
* `unexpected default branch` -- the repo HEAD is not `master`/`main`.
  Verify the upstream rename was not partial.
* `scripts/check_docs_drift.py --self-test failed` -- the drift
  checker has a syntax error or missing dependency; fix the checker
  first.
* `Athena output rejected by content allowlist` -- Athena emitted
  HTML / JS / oversize content. Inspect `docs/README.md` for the
  payload and investigate the Athena run.
* `Athena produced unexpected file changes` -- Athena wrote outside
  `README.md`/`docs/`. Inspect git status; this is a strong signal
  that the Athena CLI was misconfigured.
* `signed commit failed` -- the GPG bot key is missing, expired, or
  the GPG agent is not reachable. Verify with
  `echo test | gpg --clearsign -u athena-bot@forgeborn.dev`.
* `drift remains after sync` -- the README references files that no
  longer exist or claims that don't match reality. Check the TheForge
  `open_questions` table for the captured drift output, then either
  patch by hand or extend the sync helper.
