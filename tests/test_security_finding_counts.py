"""Regression tests for SECURITY-REVIEW finding-count extraction (task 2315).

Bug: the orchestrator security-review section header used to count
CRITICAL/HIGH severity by substring-scanning raw agent stdout. That counted
severity mentions in prose ("[S1] LOW — this is NOT a CRITICAL because…") as
actual findings, producing false-alarm headers that did not match the final
SECURITY-REVIEW-NNNN.md artifact.

Fix: parse the structured finding headers in the saved
SECURITY-REVIEW-NNNN.md artifact instead. If the artifact does not exist,
emit a distinct "missing artifact" warning rather than counterfeit counts.

These tests guard:
  - Counts from the artifact match the real finding headers
  - Raw-stdout substring counts of CRITICAL/HIGH are NOT used
  - Missing artifact => no fake counts, missing-artifact warning instead
  - Zero-findings (approve) review reports zero, not a stdout-derived guess
