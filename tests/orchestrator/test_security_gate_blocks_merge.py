"""Regression fixtures for task #2451 unified merge gate.

Covers the four gate-related invariants the orchestrator is required to
uphold across both single-task (``cli._gated_post_merge``) and parallel
(``dispatch._gated_merge_task``) dispatch modes:

  1. CRITICAL/HIGH findings block the merge.
  2. Missing / unparseable / fallback-marker artifacts fail-closed (the
     defensive invariant in ``_merge_task_branch``).
  3. ``review_blocks_merge=False`` does NOT short-circuit the artifact
     re-read — a HIGH on disk still blocks even if the caller asserts
     "do not block".
  4. Loosened header regex still detects findings written in non-canonical
     formats (no brackets, bold severity).

Subprocess calls pass ``timeout=10`` and isolate from the developer's
global git config (``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL``/``GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM``) so the
tests run hermetically (task #2451 GATE-08).
