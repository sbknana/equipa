"""Unit + hermetic coverage for the single ground-truth merge gate (task #2706).

Task #2706 closed the merge-gate caller-trust hole by moving the gate policy
into ONE pure function — :func:`equipa.security_gate.decide_merge_gate` — that
computes a single :class:`GateDecision` from ground truth (the real branch
diff + the on-disk artifact) instead of trusting caller-supplied booleans.

The sibling ``test_security_gate_blocks_merge.py`` exercises the policy
*transitively* through ``dispatch._gated_merge_task`` (which needs a real git
repo). This module complements it by:

  1. Unit-testing ``decide_merge_gate`` DIRECTLY with an injected spy artifact
     reader, so every decision branch — and the fact that a caller can no
     longer inject a per-task trust flag — is pinned without git.
  2. Adding the two operator-policy branches that were introduced by #2706 but
     were not yet exercised end-to-end: the ``security_review_enabled=False``
     operator opt-out and the ``block_on_missing=False`` fail-open escape
     hatch, both driven through the unified ``_gated_merge_task``.

Hermetic: the git-backed tests isolate from the developer's global git config
(``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL``/``GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM``) and cap every subprocess at
``timeout=10`` (task #2451 GATE-08 convention, mirrored here).
