"""Acceptance tests for SECURITY-REVIEW-1728 RT-01/RT-02/RT-03 hardening.

These tests are the explicit acceptance criteria from task 2453:

* RT-01 — Routing scoring is keyword-stuffing-resistant: a description with
  20x "simple trivial" still scores >= the priority-implied tier.
* RT-02 — Circuit-breaker fallback NEVER escalates cost: trip Haiku breaker,
  dispatch falls DOWN to fail-closed, NEVER to Sonnet/Opus.
* RT-03 — Concurrent dispatch fixture: 10 parallel calls do not corrupt
  circuit state.
