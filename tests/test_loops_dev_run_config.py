"""Regression test for TheForge task #2095 / architecture review #2093 finding S1.

Bug:
    ``equipa/loops.py::run_dev_test_loop`` referenced the local
    ``dev_run_config`` dict at two sites (read at ~line 707, write at
    ~line 829) without ever initialising it. Every dev-test cycle that
    entered the analysis-paralysis retry path therefore raised
    ``NameError: name 'dev_run_config' is not defined`` at module import
    of ``equipa.loops`` was fine, but at the FIRST call to
    ``dispatch_agent`` the lookup of ``dev_run_config.get(...)`` blew up.
    The orchestrator could not even dispatch a fix for itself because
    its own startup hit the same NameError path.

Bootstrap fix (commit 1a9d945, 2026-05-02):
    Inserted ``dev_run_config: dict[str, Any] = {}`` near line 540,
    BEFORE the cycle loop, so both reference sites work.

This test guards the fix two ways:

1. **Static check** — inspect the source of ``run_dev_test_loop`` and
   assert that an assignment to ``dev_run_config`` appears before any
   reference to it. If a future refactor deletes the init line again,
   this fails immediately at collection time.

2. **Runtime check** — drive one full dev-test cycle through
   ``run_dev_test_loop`` with the heavy deps stubbed. The cycle is
   forced down the analysis-paralysis branch, which exercises both
   reference sites (``dev_run_config.get(...)`` at line ~707 and
   ``dev_run_config["_paralysis_retry_count"] = ...`` at line ~829).
   On the second cycle the test verifies the read site picked up the
   value the write site stored (paralysis_retry_count=1). If the init
   is removed, the very first dispatch raises NameError before this
   assertion is reachable.
