"""Regression tests for task 2448.

Single-task --dev-test mode MUST enforce the security-review merge gate the
same way parallel mode does. Previously the gate was absent in single-task
mode: the review ran, persisted SECURITY-REVIEW-{id}.md, but the merge
proceeded regardless of CRITICAL/HIGH findings (see task #2382 incident
2026-05-19).

These tests pin the corrected behavior:
- HIGH/CRITICAL findings block the worktree merge and demote outcome.
- A clean review allows the merge.
- A doc-only diff skips the gate (task 2360 parity).
- A missing artifact, with the flag on, fails closed (task 2341 parity).

    Task 2448 / SECURITY-REVIEW-2448 S1 (HIGH): the 2448 spec enumerated
    5 tests; the file shipped 4. This is the 5th. Without it the doc-only
    short-circuit in cli.py:1088-1117 is unverified — a refactor could
    turn every doc-only commit into a blocked merge (or, worse, the
    opposite: a refactor that drops the short-circuit would block every
    doc-only spec commit, breaking the task 2358 use case the
    short-circuit was added for in the first place).

    The cli.py:1088-1117 wiring is:

        review_skipped_doc_only = is_doc_only_diff(changed_files)
        if review_skipped_doc_only:
            ...  # do NOT call run_security_review, do NOT block
        else:
            ...  # run review, evaluate gate

    So the unit-level contract is: ``is_doc_only_diff`` returns True for
    any diff that contains only documentation extensions, and False the
    moment a code file is present. The integration test in
    test_single_task_devtest_security_gate_integration.py
    (test_doc_only_diff_skips_gate_end_to_end) covers the wiring end-to-end.
