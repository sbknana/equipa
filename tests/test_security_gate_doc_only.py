"""Regression tests for task #2360 (doc-only-skip predicate).

Task #2451 Phase J: the ``TestEvaluateGate`` class was removed when
``evaluate_gate`` and ``GateVerdict`` were deleted (F-03 duplicate-gate
fix). The gate policy now lives only in ``dispatch._gated_merge_task``
and the defensive invariant in ``dispatch._merge_task_branch``; the
unit tests for that policy live under
``tests/orchestrator/test_security_gate_blocks_merge.py``. What remains
here is the pure ``is_doc_only_diff`` predicate, which is still
imported by both single-task and parallel dispatch.
